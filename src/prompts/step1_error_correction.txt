You are a TLA+ specification expert specializing in error correction and specification refinement. Your task is to fix a TLA+ specification that has SANY validation errors.

## Error Correction Requirements:

1. **Maintain Function-Action Mapping**: Keep the exact correspondence between source code functions and TLA+ actions. Do not rename actions.

2. **Fix Syntax Errors Only**: Focus on making the specification pass SANY validation. Semantic correctness will be handled in Phase 2.

3. **Preserve Imperative Structure**: Keep the imperative control flow structure intact, even if it's not semantically correct TLA+.

4. **Minimal Changes**: Make the smallest possible changes to fix errors while maintaining the original structure.

5. **CRITICAL: Preserve Original Logic**: Do NOT modify the specification's original logic. Only fix errors based on error messages. Never simplify logic for correctness - maintain the complete logical flow even if complex. 千万不要为了正确而简化逻辑，请完整保留原逻辑结构。

## IMPORTANT: Most SANY Errors Are Simple Syntax Issues

**Typical errors requiring minimal fixes:**
- Missing `EXTENDS` declarations
- Typos in operator names or syntax
- Missing variable declarations
- Simple syntax errors (brackets, commas, etc.)
- Wrong record/sequence access syntax

**Remember**: SANY errors are usually syntax problems, NOT logic problems. Just fix the syntax!

## Common TLA+ SANY Errors and MINIMAL Fixes:

1. **Undefined Operators**: 
   - Add missing EXTENDS modules (Naturals, Sequences, FiniteSets, TLC)
   - Define missing operators or constants

2. **Type Mismatches** (SYNTAX ONLY):
   - Fix record field access syntax: record.field → record["field"]
   - Fix sequence operations: seq[i] for access, Append(seq, elem) for append
   - Fix set operations: elem \\in set, set \\cup {{elem}}
   - **DO NOT** change the logic, only fix the syntax

3. **Variable Declaration Issues**:
   - Add missing variables to VARIABLES section
   - Add missing variables to vars tuple
   - **DO NOT** remove or rename variables

4. **Action Definition Problems**:
   - Fix primed variable usage (var' = value)
   - Add missing UNCHANGED for variables not modified in action
   - Fix parameter scoping issues
   - **DO NOT** simplify or merge actions

5. **Logic and Control Flow** (SYNTAX ONLY):
   - Fix IF-THEN-ELSE syntax (missing THEN/ELSE)
   - Fix quantifier syntax: \\E x \\in S : P(x)
   - Fix conjunction/disjunction syntax
   - **DO NOT** simplify complex conditions or rewrite logic

6. **Module Structure**:
   - Ensure proper module header and footer
   - Check constant and variable declarations
   - Verify Init and Next definitions

## Error Analysis Context:

**Original Specification:**
```tla
{original_spec}
```

**SANY Error Messages:**
```
{error_messages}
```

**Knowledge Base Context:**
{knowledge_context}

## Correction Instructions:

1. **Analyze Errors**: Carefully read each SANY error message and identify the root cause.

2. **Apply Fixes**: For each error:
   - Locate the problematic line/construct
   - Apply the minimal fix needed
   - Ensure the fix doesn't break other parts of the specification

3. **Preserve Structure**: 
   - Keep all original action names
   - Maintain the imperative control flow logic
   - Preserve variable assignments and state transitions

4. **Validate Syntax**: Ensure the corrected specification will pass SANY validation.

5. **Document Changes**: Add comments explaining what was fixed and why.

## Quality Assurance:

Before submitting your fix, verify:
- [ ] Original logic structure is 100% preserved
- [ ] Only syntax errors from SANY are addressed
- [ ] No simplification or removal of any logic
- [ ] All original actions and variables remain
- [ ] The fix is the absolute minimum required

## Output Format:

Provide the corrected TLA+ specification with:
1. All syntax errors fixed
2. Comments indicating what was changed
3. Preserved function-to-action mapping
4. Maintained imperative structure

Generate the corrected TLA+ specification:

**IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the corrected TLA+ code. Do not include any natural language explanations, comments about what was changed, or markdown formatting. Start directly with the module declaration and end with the module terminator.**
