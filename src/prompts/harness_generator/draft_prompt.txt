Goal: produce a harness design + implementation plan (do not modify code).

Deliver a concise, actionable plan covering:
- Objectives of the harness (what it must validate)
- Key entry points/files to touch
- Data/inputs it needs (paths, fixtures, env vars)
- Steps to implement and run it (commands, expected outputs)
- Risks/assumptions and open questions

Format the answer as Markdown with clear section headers. Keep it short and prioritized.
