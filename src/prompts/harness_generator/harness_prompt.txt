2) Run it (or best-effort simulate if tools unavailable) and capture results.
3) Report what changed, how to run it, and the run outcome.

Constraints:
- Prefer minimal changes; reuse existing patterns.
- If something cannot be executed, state why and what to do next.

Return a short Markdown report with:
- Summary of changes
- Commands you ran (or would run) and their results
- Next steps / blockers
