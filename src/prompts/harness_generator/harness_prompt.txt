You are Codex. Repository root: {repo_path}

You already have a harness plan (draft) at: {draft_path}

Draft content:
```
{draft}
```

Your tasks:

### 1. Implement the harness according to the draft
- Create only the files and code necessary to realize the draft’s design.
- Follow the repository’s existing patterns, coding style, and directory structure.
- Prefer additive changes; avoid modifying existing code unless explicitly required.
- For any required modifications, apply only minimal, safe edits.

### 2. Validate or simulate execution
- If the environment allows execution, run the harness end-to-end.
- Do not simulate execution, do not invent fake outputs, and do not describe hypothetical “would run” scenarios.
- If execution is not possible (missing dependencies, VM/QEMU unavailable, sandbox limitations), simulate the expected workflow:
  - Describe exactly which commands *would* be run.
  - Describe expected outputs, artifacts, logs, and trace files.
  - Explain assumptions clearly.

### 3. Produce a final report
Return a concise Markdown report containing:

#### **Summary of What You Implemented**
- New files created
- Existing files modified (if any)
- Key logic and how it fulfills the draft

#### **Run Instructions & (Simulated) Results**
- Exact commands run (or to be run)
- Actual or expected outputs (e.g., trace.jsonl, logs, success markers)

#### **Next Steps / Blockers**
- Any missing information needed from maintainers
- Any repository issues that prevent full execution
- Recommended follow-up improvements to the harness

### Constraints
- Do not invent repository structure; infer from the repo.
- Do not produce large placeholder code; write realistic and consistent code modules.
- Keep the report short, structured, and actionable.
