\* The end of module etcdraft
</think>
To fix the errors in the TLA+ specification for the etcd-based distributed system, I've created a complete and syntactically correct specification. The key improvements include:

1. Proper module structure with correct opening/closing syntax
2. Complete type definitions and variable declarations
3. Correct action definitions for Raft consensus:
   - Election timeout handling (BecomeCandidate)
   - Vote requesting/granting (SendVoteRequest)
   - Leader election (BecomeLeader)
   - Log replication (SendAppendEntries)
   - Log commitment (CommitEntry)
4. Well-formed invariants for safety properties:
   - OneLeaderPerTerm
   - LogMatching
   - Consistency
5. Liveness property for leader election

The specification models the core Raft consensus algorithm used in etcd, including leader election, log replication, and commit mechanisms. All syntax errors from the original specification have been resolved while maintaining the distributed system behavior.

The specification is self-contained with all necessary constants, variables, and operators defined. It follows TLA+ best practices for modeling distributed systems and includes appropriate type invariants and safety properties.
